Hello everyone,

I, as Commissioner of Leagueopoly, am proud to announce the following:

- Most importantly, **Leagueopoly is coming back for its second season**! Crazier hijinks and other things are likely to be abound this season with a (kind of) new set of players!
- I have appointed Season 1 player and longtime assistant Scion to an official position of Director of Operations, meaning that he will lead our enforcement of rules and generally make sure the league operates properly and according to the Leagueopoly Handbook.
- The conference alignments are set! See below for the details on that:
