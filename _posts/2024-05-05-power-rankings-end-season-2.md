# #1 - Scion - <a href="/players/scion">(player profile)</a>
Scion showed dominance in the Community Chest Conference, especially after his not-so-strong first season. In Season 1, he ended up last in points (39 points), trades accepted (41 trades), and in total net worth ($50,312). In Season 2, however, Scion has broken the regular season records for total wins (7 wins), total points (83), and total net worth ($98,469).

# #2 - cstro - <a href="/players/cstro">(player profile)</a>
After just barely missing out on the Championship last season, cstro was able to lead the Chance Conference and handily make it this season. He has the highest trade acceptance rate at 90.9% and is tied for the most wins in the conference with Samuel (5 wins).

# #3 - Samuel - <a href="/players/samuel">(player profile)</a>
Samuel is returning to the Championship after finishing last in Season 1’s Championship by points (18 points). He was able to return mostly due to his dominant win streak of four games in a row in the Chance Conference (games 9-12) that is still active. Additionally, Samuel is leading the league in the amount of times owning the New York property (8 times).

# #4 - Tom - <a href="/players/tom">(player profile)</a>
Even though Tom has the least amount of points of all Championship contenders, he has tons of experience in Leagueopoly. Tom only had one win this season, being tied in wins with awed, who did not perform as stellarly, but that is contrasted by his 56 total points, giving him the edge over Inkydink in obtaining a Championship berth. Also, Tom did finish second in last season’s Championship, earning 23 points. Tom also held the most points (69 points) and was tied in having the most wins (5 wins) last season, so he has experience playing at a high level.

# #5 - Inkydink - <a href="/players/inkydink">(player profile)</a>
Although he was a rookie this season, Inkydink was just inches away from being in the Championship. Before games 10-12 of the Community Chest, Inkydink had 42 points, putting him in fierce competition with Tom (43 points). Unfortunately, Inkydink finished in fourth place in the last two games of the series, which led him to end up with 45 points on the season. However, he was second in the Community Chest Conference in total net worth ($56,909).

# #6 - Hydrogen - <a href="/players/hydrogen">(player profile)</a>
Hydrogen only played 6 games this season, as he joined the Chance Conference as a replacement after Josephine left. Hydrogen did play very well despite this, though. Although he did not win any of the six games he played, he was able to place second three times and placed fourth only once. He ended the season with 39 points after inheriting 75% of Josephine’s points. However, Hydrogen did have one of the worst trade acceptance rates in the league at 52.9%.

# #7 - TRM - <a href="/players/trm">(player profile)</a>
After having a solid first season, TRM had a mediocre second season, especially in the second half. He was second in the Chance Conference going into games 7-9, having 21 points. However, he placed fourth in three of the last six games of the season. But, TRM did have one of the highest single game net worths in the league at $12,744 in game one this season.

# #8 - awed - <a href="/players/awed">(player profile)</a>
There is no doubt that awed had a very lackluster performance in his rookie season. He was able to obtain his first and only win of the season after 10 games, albeit with a substitute playing for him. Most of his stats are among the lowest in the league, including points (32 points) and total net worth ($43,409). He also had a four game streak where he placed fourth (games 3-6) and only placed second once before game 10. However, it is also noted that awed often had very bad luck in these games.
