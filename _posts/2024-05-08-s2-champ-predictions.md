The Championship is here, which means one winner will be crowned the champion of Season 2 of Leagueopoly. The editorial team here at Leagueopoly.com decided to run a poll with the players to see their predictions on who will be the champion.

# How the Championship works
In the Leagueopoly Championships, the best two players by points in each conference are allowed to be in the championship. This is, so far, the only way that the players from other conferences can officially play against each other. This year‚Äôs championship contenders are cstro and Samuel from the Chance Conference and Scion and Tom from the Community Chest Conference. After five games, the player who receives the most points is the official champion of that season of play. Last year‚Äôs champion was Josephine from the Chance Conference.

# Predictions
In a poll that was given to all eight players, only one player did not vote. The results are the following:

- 4 votes for Scion (US)
- 2 votes for Samuel (AU)
- 1 vote for Tom (UK)
- 0 votes for cstro (US)

By a decent margin, Scion is predicted to be the winner of the championship. It is safe to say that the choice of Scion as champion is a safe choice as he has both the most points (83 points) and the most wins (7 wins) in the league this season. 

I first asked fellow Community Chest Conference member Inkydink why he voted for Scion as champion. Inkydink simply stated ‚ÄúScion swept nearly all the games I played with him,‚Äù and when asked for his expectations, Inkydink stated ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to sweep again duh üò≠.‚Äù
I also asked TRM, Commissioner of the league, better known as Michael Webb, and he stated ‚ÄúScion has had a dominating performance throughout this season, and I really don't expect him to slow down in the Championship.‚Äù Michael Webb also predicted that Scion would earn around 30 points.

However, asking the highly favored Scion on his thoughts on who would win it all, he stated that Samuel would win it all. Scion said ‚ÄúEven though I'm this season's leader in points, I do feel that Samuel might have some ways to combat my play. From what I've seen of Samuel's play, I think his biggest strength is going to be coming back from a disadvantaged state. I feel his trading game is better than mine, and he's generally able to get the properties he needs to either outright win games or survive long enough to place in second.‚Äù When asked for his prediction on the amount of points earned for Samuel, Scion predicted a point total of 38.

I also asked Tom his thoughts on who would win the championship. Tom was second in points in last season‚Äôs championship and earned the most points in the league last season (69 points). He said that Samuel would win the championship by stating ‚Äú(Samuel‚Äôs) a pretty strong player, getting a lot of points in both (Season 1) and (Season 2)‚Äù and that Samuel ‚Äúmanaged to get into the s1 championship.‚Äù Tom also jokingly added ‚Äú(Samuel‚Äôs) Australian, so that's better than voting for an American.‚Äù

As for the one vote for Tom, that was voted on by Hydrogen. Hydrogen just simply stated that he hoped Tom would win as Hydrogen was also rooting for Tom last season. As stated before, Tom did lead the league last season in points with a total of 69 points.

There were no votes for cstro to win the championship, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he has potential to do so. He is currently the Chance Conference leader in points (74 points) and is tied with Samuel in wins (5 wins).

Ultimately, everyone has a shot at the championship this season. To see who will win, tune into today‚Äôs set of games. Season 2 Championship games one through three will be played tonight at 6:30 EDT (UTC:-4:00) and will be hosted on TheRandomMelon‚Äôs Twitch channel.
