The past couple days have been massive for the league. After months of scheduling conflicts, there were three streams in the last eight days, including the first ever stream with 4 games. Despite the schedule conflicts, the regular season has wrapped up for both conferences and the players for the championship have been decided.

The final stretch of games of both the Community Chest Conference (Games 10-12) and the Chance Conference (Games 9-12) were very intense with all players trying their best to get into the championship. 

Before Community Chest Games 10-12, the conference had Triforce, Tom, and Scion relatively close to each other in points, with 48, 44, and 46 points respectively. Rose, on the other hand, started with 24 points, which did not eliminate her from championship contention but did make her chances quite low. In Game 10, she finished in 4th place, eliminating her from championship contention. She did still have a massive impact in the later games, as in Game 11, she won her second game of the season. Scion didn’t win any games in the final stream, but he did consistently earn 2nd place in all 3 games, which gave him 15 points to add to his total and had him end the season with 61 points. Tom won and Triforce placed last in Game 10 and they both didn’t perform the best in Game 11, where Tom finished 4th and Triforce finished 3rd. Game 12 had Tom and Triforce with the same amount of points at 54 points a piece, with Scion at a close 56 points. The last game could have ended any way for Tom, Scion, and Triforce, but the championship was determined when Tom placed 4th, earning zero points and guaranteeing Triforce and Scion their seats in the championship. Triforce did end up winning the game which gave him his 4th win of the season, same amount of wins as Tom, and the highest points for a Community Chest player at 64 points. The win also ended the non-1st place streak for Triforce of 6 games.

Over in the Chance Conference, they hosted the first four game stream in Leagueopoly history, after hosting a two game stream (Games 7-8) that was supposed to be a regular three-game stream, but Game 9 had to be delayed due to two missing players. Hydrogen was sitting in a comfortable lead going into Game 9 at 53 points, while TRM held 2nd place at the time at 37 points. Samuel, a two time championship contender, had 31 points and Josephine, having Scion as a substitute, had 23 points. The odds for Josephine getting into the championship was low, but it got even lower when she placed 4th in Game 9. Josephine would win Game 10, boosting her small odds to get into the championship, but she would go on to lose Game 11, eliminating her from the playoffs. Hydrogen would start off rough, getting 3rd place in Games 9 and 10, however, he would go onto get second place in Game 11 and win Game 12, giving him the most wins and points for the season at 5 wins and 74 points. This would then start the battle for Samuel and TRM to get into the championship. TRM would get 2nd in Game 9, but Samuel would win that game and Game 11. Samuel would also place 2nd place in Games 10 and 12, having him earn 30 points in the stretch of games. TRM on the other hand would have it rough after Game 9, as he would place 4th twice and 3rd once, securing Samuel’s seat in the championship after a dominant stretch of games and giving him his third consecutive championship appearance. 

But with all of the games completed, how do all of the players in both conferences stack up against each other? Here are the overall power rankings:
